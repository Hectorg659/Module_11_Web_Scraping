## Summary
This challenge included 2 primary parts. The first part was to scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles. The second part was to Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which is pulled from a table. In this challenge we used Pandas functions to assist in analyzing the data. Once both steps are completed, we exported the DataFrame to a CSV file and saved it in the correct folder.
